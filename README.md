# UBC Data Science Tookit
## Assignment 6

# Purpose:

This repository contains source files for the 6th assignment for the Data Science Toolkit course at UBC.

The Jupyter notebook contained in the reports folder runs the code in src and uses Pandas for data science tasks, matplotlib for data visualizations, and scikit to run machine learning models to predict outcomes based on data in the data folder.

This project can be duplicated using the environment.yaml file in your environment.
